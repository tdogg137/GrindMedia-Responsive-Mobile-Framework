# GrindMedia Mobile Responsive Template

## Overview

The GrindMedia Mobile Responsive Template is a **work in progress** meant to be used as a *starting point* for a mobile theming project on the GrindMedia family of WordPress instances. Not a theme in itself, but a DOM and style template to begin building mobile WordPress themes.

##Components

###Built on LESS
The basic styles for layout, typography, resets etc. are all written in LESS. [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) is a dynamic stylesheet language, also known as a CSS pre-processor. As an extension to CSS, LESS is not only backwards compatible with CSS, but the extra features it adds use existing CSS syntax. Dive in and learn more about LESS, and how to compile your LESS files [HERE](http://verekia.com/less-css/dont-read-less-css-tutorial-highly-addictive).

###Font Awesome
[Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) is an icon font originally designed for use with Twitter Bootstrap, but is so scalable and works well on so many modern mobile devices that it's included in the template as well.

###Flexnav
The GrindMEdia Mobile Responsive Template uses a version of the jQuery plugin [Flexnav](https://github.com/indyplanets/flexnav) as a mobile-first technique  of using media queries and jQuery to create a touch based navigation menu with drop downs. Special attention is paid to touch screens using click events.

##View the Templates
To view the templates for the Mobile Responsive Template, point your local server to the ***~/views/*** folder of the template files, and view each file individually.

##Test in Mobile
Due to some of the responsive overrides in the styles, this layout wont look exactly correct in the browser unless you're testing with a mobile user-agent.

###OSX
Apples [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) includes an iOS Simulator that is perfect for testing.

###Browser Based
Chrome and Firefox all have native, or plugin supported, User Agent switching. There are tutorials out there which can explain how to change your user agent for the purpose of testing.
